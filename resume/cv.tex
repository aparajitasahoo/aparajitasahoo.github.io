\textit{A project aiming to solve important problems faced by dermatologists in diagnosis in rural areas}
\vspace{4pt}

\noindent \textbf{The first part} is a study aimed at reducing the subjectivity in visual examination of skin diseases, especially in depigmented conditions. Here, it is difficult to diagnose similar looking diseases without an intravenous procedure like biopsy. We have developed a non-intravenous method to identify the condition which is much faster, cheaper and less painful than existing methods. The device is a fluorescence spectroscopy test that can be done with the help of a mobile phone. I have been involved in collaborating with doctors to design and implement this study at the K. J. Somaiya Hospital, Mumbai. I have been actively helping doctors to collect data using our device, from around 200 skin patients over a period of 5 months. I have been working on analyzing this data and improving the design and user interface based on feedback from doctors. We plan to publish the results of this study at a prominent healthcare conference.
\vspace{4pt}

\noindent \textbf{The second part} of the project is a portable mobile clip-on that can be used by dermatologists in visual examination of the skin. This affordable app-based device provides magnified, high quality and polarized images of skin lesions and allows one to annotate, store and access them along with patient data. I was involved in giving inputs for its design and usability. I was involved in a pilot study that included doctors from K. J. Somaiya hospital to test the device on their patients and give us critical feedback of its design and app interface. Its success led us to mass-manufacture the clip-on, to be distributed to about 500 dermatologists in and around Mumbai. \\

\textit{A project aiming to provide better detection of cardiovascular disorders in rural areas}
\vspace{4pt}

\noindent Cardiovascular diseases, among all reasons, cause the maximum number ($\sim$ 1.4 million) of deaths per year in India. Rural areas are especially affected due to a lack of doctors specializing in diagnosis of these disorders. We aimed to solve this problem with a screening device that helps in detecting heart murmurs in patients leading to possible further diagnosis and treatment. The device combines a digital stethoscope and an ECG to identify irregularities in heartbeat. I had developed the hardware prototype which led to better data collection. The user interface of the device designed to be simple for use by a health worker and its form factor was reduced to make it portable. This was used to collect data samples from various patients and the preliminary data was analyzed to detect similarities in their pattern.\\ 
This project was \textit{presented to Ratan Tata} and it got positive feedback.

\item[]\textbf{Super--Resolution with Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy} \\
The maximum number of independent samples that an imaging setup can extract from the imaged scene is dictated by the limits set by Fourier optics: if the imaged scene is wide--field, there are limits on how much one can zoom in. However, wide--field, high--resolution images are generally desirable in microscopy, pathology and eye imaging. Traditional methods to achieve this, ptychography, for instance, involve mechanical adjustment and require precise control and actuation. Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy was introduced in 2013 as a computational tool to work around this. The idea is to shift, in the Fourier domain, high--frequency information to low frequencies (where the system's optics do not filter it), sense it, and shift it back while reconstructing. We worked on understanding and implementing this method for microscopy slides, and analyzed possible extensions to imaging reflective surfaces like the eye.

{\bf A Bayesian Framework for Laparoscopic Image Dehazing and Denoising} \\
{\em Guide: \href{https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash}{\textcolor{blue}{Prof. Suyash Awate}}, CSE, IITB} \hfill {\it January 2015 -- Present} \\
\vspace*{-.13in}
\begin{list1}
\item[]
Laparoscopic images in minimally invasive surgery get corrupted by surgical smoke and noise. This degrades the quality of the surgery and the results of further processing for, say, segmentation and tracking. Algorithms for desmoking and denoising laparoscopic images seem to be missing in the medical vision literature. We formulated the problem of joint desmoking and denoising of laparoscopic images as a Bayesian inference problem. This formulation relies on a novel probabilistic graphical model of images, which includes a Markov Random Field (MRF) formulation for color-contrast and another MRF for smoothness on the uncorrupted color image as well as the transmission-map image that indicates color attenuation due to smoke. We resort to a mode approximation (using gradient descent) to the Bayesian posterior to estimate the underlying scene. The results on simulated and real-world laparoscopic images, with clinical expert evaluation, shows the advantages of our method over the state of the art. We now extend this framework to include speckle removal, with better optimization techniques like Variational Bayes--based Expectation Maximization.

\begin{list1}
\item[]
Recent efforts to apply the principles of compressed sensing to video data involve combining frames into coded snapshots while sensing and separating them with an over--complete dictionary. This works well, but needs a dictionary at the same frame--rate and time--smoothness as the video. We try relaxing this constraint using a source--separation approach to this problem where precise error bounds on recovery have been derived. We designed practically--realizable positive patch--wise sensing matrices that have low mutual coherence in all circular permutations, which facilitates accurate overlapping patchwise recovery. We currently aim to design general sensing matrices with quantities that yield tighter error bounds than the coherence. We thus explore bounds (like the $l_1$--CSMV and $l_\infty$--based bounds) which `soften' the sparsity criterion for $l_1$ recovery, resulting in quantities verifiable in polynomial time, as opposed to the RIC bound which is combinatorial and therefore difficult to optimize.

The mechanical subsystem designed and developed a rover with a rocker-bogie suspension and novel air-filled beach tires. The electrical and software team designed power, logic and communication circuits for on-board control. Currently, localization and autonomous navigation are being developed. The role of machine vision for automating rover operations is being explored. One of the design goals for the future is to develop the capability to help astronauts on space missions. We participated in a simulated Martian expedition and tested Rover capabilities in the harsh conditions of the Australian outback, at the \href{http://marssociety.org.au/article/arkaroola-mars-robot-challenge-spaceward-bound-expedition}{\textcolor{blue} {Arkaroola Mars Robot Challenge}}.
