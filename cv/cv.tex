\section{\sc Research Interests}
\lettrine[lines=2]{I}{} am passionate about creating a social impact by working at the intersection of health technologies, data science, design and social innovation that will impact the lives of the people globally. I am also interested in enhancing  user experiences by combining the power of computing, mobile technologies and effective design. I have also worked on electronics prototyping of low cost healthcare devices that can be deployed in rural areas that donâ€™t have access to medical facilities.

\textit{A project aiming to solve important problems faced by dermatologists in diagnosis in rural areas}
\vspace{4pt}

\noindent \textbf{The first part} is a study aimed at reducing the subjectivity in visual examination of skin diseases, especially in depigmented conditions. Here, it is difficult to diagnose similar looking diseases without an intravenous procedure like biopsy. We have developed a non-intravenous method to identify the condition which is much faster, cheaper and less painful than existing methods. The device is a fluorescence spectroscopy test that can be done with the help of a mobile phone. I have been involved in collaborating with doctors to design and implement this study at the K. J. Somaiya Hospital, Mumbai. I have been actively helping doctors to collect data using our device, from around 200 skin patients over a period of 5 months. I have been working on analyzing this data and improving the design and user interface based on feedback from doctors. We plan to publish the results of this study at a prominent healthcare conference.
\vspace{4pt}

\noindent \textbf{The second part} of the project is a portable mobile clip-on that can be used by dermatologists in visual examination of the skin. This affordable app-based device provides magnified, high quality and polarized images of skin lesions and allows one to annotate, store and access them along with patient data. I was involved in giving inputs for its design and usability. I was involved in a pilot study that included doctors from K. J. Somaiya hospital to test the device on their patients and give us critical feedback of its design and app interface. Its success led us to mass-manufacture the clip-on, to be distributed to about 500 dermatologists in and around Mumbai. \\

\textit{A project aiming to provide better detection of cardiovascular disorders in rural areas}
\vspace{4pt}

\noindent Cardiovascular diseases, among all reasons, cause the maximum number ($\sim$ 1.4 million) of deaths per year in India. Rural areas are especially affected due to a lack of doctors specializing in diagnosis of these disorders. We aimed to solve this problem with a screening device that helps in detecting heart murmurs in patients leading to possible further diagnosis and treatment. The device combines a digital stethoscope and an ECG to identify irregularities in heartbeat. I had developed the hardware prototype which led to better data collection. The user interface of the device designed to be simple for use by a health worker and its form factor was reduced to make it portable. This was used to collect data samples from various patients and the preliminary data was analyzed to detect similarities in their pattern.\\ 
This project was \textit{presented to Ratan Tata} and it got positive feedback.

\textit{A project aiming test for visual field in infants with cerebral palsy} 
\vspace{4pt}

\noindent Peripheral vision impairment is an indicator of potential abnormalities in the human body. It is a challenge to measure the visual field of an infant suffering from physical disabilities like cerebral palsy where the body's movement is restricted and the patient cannot be tested in the standard way. Pediatric Perimeter is a novel device to measure and quantify visual fields and reaction times to light stimulus in infants. This device assists in the early detection of neonatal eye diseases and early signs of vision-threatening conditions. 
The prototype we made recorded the response and the movement of pupil. I was a part of the initial team that had started the project and was involved in hardware prototyping and design of the enclosure. We had tested it on few babies and got valuable feedback. 

\noindent The first version was presented to Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and received encouraging reviews.
